# Chapter 05: 랭체인으로 RAG 구현하기
## 02. RAG 기반의 챗봇 만들기
- 아래와 같은 요소를 이용하여 서비스를 만들어본다.

|라이브러리|langchain, unstructured, sentence-transformers, chromadb|
|:---:|:---:|
|언어 모델|llama3|
|임베딩 모델|all-MiniLM-L6-v2|
|벡터 데이터베이스|크로마(chroma)|

- RAG를 구현할 것이므로 데이터가 필요하다.
- 책의 예제에서는 위키피디아에서 찾은 AI 검색 결과를 텍스트로 저장해둔 파일을 사용한다.
- 먼저 사용할 라이브러리를 설치한다.
```py
!pip install unstructured
!pip install sentence-transformers
!pip install chromadb
```
- `unstructured`: 텍스트 파일 같은 구조화되지 않은 데이터를 다루는 데 사용한다.
- `chromadb`: 벡터를 저장하고 유사도 검색을 지원한다.
- `sentence-transformers`: 문장을 벡터로 변환하고 이를 통해 텍스트 데이터의 의미적 유사성을 계산하기 위해 사용한다.
- 설치 완료 후 텍스트 파일 (AI.txt)을 가져온다.
- 파일을 불러오는 것은 `TextLoader`를 이용한다.
```py
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
documents = TextLoader('C:/Users/ryuta/PycharmProjects/JupyterProject/data/AI.txt').load()
```
- 문장을 청크로 분할한다.
- 큰 덩어리의 문서를 작은 덩어리로 분할하는 과정으로, 랭체인에서 제공하는 `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`를 이용한다.
```py
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# 문서를 청크로 분할
def split_docs(documents, chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=20):
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
        chunk_size=chunk_size,
        chunk_overlap=chunk_overlap
    )
    docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
    return docs
 
# docs 변수에 분할 문서를 저장
docs = split_docs(documents)
```
- 벡터 데이터베이스인 크로마에 임베딩 처리된 벡터를 저장한다.
- 임베딩 처리는 `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` 모델을 사용한다.
```py
from typing import List, Dict
tricks: List[str] = []

from langchain.embeddings import SentenceTransformerEmbeddings
embeddings = SentenceTransformerEmbeddings(model_name='all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# ChromaDB에 벡터 저장
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
db = Chroma.from_documents(documents=docs, embedding=embeddings)
```
- 텍스트 파일에서 관련 내용을 찾아 LLM에 제공하면 LLM이 답변을 생성한다.
```py
from langchain.llms import Ollama
model_name = 'llama3'
llm = Ollama(model=model_name)

# Q%A 체일을 사용하여 쿼리에 대한 답변 얻기
from langchain.chains.question_answering import load_qa_chain
chain = load_qa_chain(llm, chain_type='stuff', verbose=True)

# 쿼리를 작성하고 유사도 검색을 수행하여 답변을 생성, 따라서 텍스트에 있는 내용을 정의해야 한다.
query = 'AI란?'
matching_docs = db.similarity_search(query)
answer = chain.run(input_documents=matching_docs, question=query)
answer
```
- 답변 생성 결과는 아래와 같다.
```

Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of humans or animals. It is a field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. Such machines may be called AIs.

AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications are: advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative and creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (such as chess and Go).[1]

The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] General intelligence (the ability to complete any task performable by a human) is among the field's long-term goals.[11]

To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience and other fields.[12]

Alan Turing was the first person to carry out substantial research in the field that he called Machine Intelligence.[2] Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.[3] The field went through multiple cycles of optimism[4][5] followed by disappointment and loss of funding.[6][7] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques,[8] and after 2017 with the transformer architecture.[9] This led to the AI spring of the 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.[10]
